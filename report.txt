## Feature Extraction (Max 200 Words)

I have used a principle component analysis method as it was simple to implement and does a decent job with reducing the data. 
The basic PCA with no feature selection gets a word score for low resolution words of 51%. 
As we did it in two lab classes too it was the one I felt like I have the best understanding on so when it came to having issues I thought it would be easier to debug.

The first step done is to take the training data and put it in a covariance matrix. 
After that it gets the eigenvector from the covariance matrix. 
Then it takes the data passed through and takes it away from the mean of the training data to centre the data. 
After that the dot product is done to get the reduced dataset.

## Letter Classifier (Max 200 Words)

I used a simple nearest neighbour classification technique with no changed features. 
I did this because itâ€™s a simple classification technique that is very high performance. 
Cosine distance was used to measure the distance.

## Word Finder (Max 200 Words)

When originally desiging my algorithm I looked for exact word matches by trying to find the correct starting letter then expanding out in each direction.
This was effective but for both the high and the low word score it wouldn't be able to find words that the classifier may have missed.
So I re-designed it with room for assumption, I decided that 1/3 would be the threshold for how much it of the word it could guess by because its 1 wrong letter for 3 letter words.
I decided to round up to the nearest whole number as well so technically 5 letter words have a 2 letter max threshold of incorrectness.
There is another function to compare letters to find which word is closest to the correct word at the end of the program.

## Performance

My percentage correctness scores (to 1 decimal place) for the development data are as follows.

High quality data:

- Percentage Letters Correct: 99.3%
- Percentage Words Correct: 100.0%

Low quality data:

- Percentage Letters Correct: 51.0%
- Percentage Words Correct: 33.0%
